## Earthquake Prediction and Analysis
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict earthquake magnitude based on past earthquake data. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model training using linear regression and random forest models.

The project found that earthquake magnitude has a strong positive correlation with depth, and that there is a negative correlation between earthquake magnitude and latitude. Additionally, the project found that a random forest model was more accurate than a linear regression model in predicting earthquake magnitude.

The insights gained from this project can be used to inform future earthquake preparedness efforts. By understanding the factors that contribute to earthquake magnitude, it may be possible to better prepare for and respond to future earthquakes.
